                <div><p>A Florida "resident for tuition purposes" is a person who has, or a dependent person whose parent or legal guardian has, established and maintained legal residency in Florida for at least twelve (12) consecutive months preceding the first day of classes of the term for which Florida residency is sought.</p></div>

                        <li>Residence in Florida must be a bona fide domicile rather than for the purpose of maintaining a residence incident to enrollment at an institution of higher education.  </li>
                        <li>To qualify as a Florida resident for tuition purposes, you must be a U.S. citizen, a foreign national in a nonimmigrant visa classification that grants you the legal ability to establish a bona fide domicile in the United States, a permanent resident alien, parolee, asylee, Cuban-Haitian entrant, legal alien granted indefinite stay, or other qualified alien as defined under federal law.  Other persons not meeting the twelve-month legal residence requirements may be classified as Florida residents for tuition purposes only if they fall within one of the limited special categories authorized by the Florida Legislature pursuant to section 1009.21, Florida Statutes (see "Qualification by Exception").  All other persons are ineligible for classification as a Florida "resident for tuition purposes". </li>
                        <li>Living in or attending school in Florida will not, in itself, establish legal residence.  Students who depend upon out-of-state parents for support are presumed to be legal residents of the same state as their parents.</li>
                        <li>Residency for tuition purposes requires the establishment of legal ties to the state of Florida. A student must verify that the student has broken ties to other states if the student or, in the case of a dependent student, his or her parent has moved from another state. </li>
